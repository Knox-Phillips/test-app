<h1>Lesson 1: Variables</h1>
<h2 id='sub-title'>How To Save Information</h2>
<p>
In programming, we need ways to save and reuse pieces of information. Like a character's name or their age. One way we can store data is by using a <em>variable</em>. Here is an example of a variable called <code>myMood</code> that has a value of <code>Happy</code>:

<p>
  As you can see we have the name of <code>myMood</code> and then we set it equal to <code>"Happy"</code> using the = symbol. Makes sense. But what's that <code>let</code> doing out in the front? In JavaScript, in order to <em>declare</em>, or "create", a variable you have to use a special keyword first.
</p>

<h3><code>let</code> Allows Change</h3>
<p>
  If we don't mind if the variable changes its value, say <code>100</code> to <code>101</code>, then we use the <code>let</code> keyword.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myNumber = 100
myNumber = 101
</code></pre>

<p>
  Notice that when we change the variable's value, we do <b>not</b> use another let keyword. We only use the <code>let</code> keyword once.
</p>

<h3><code>const</code> Means Constant</h3>
<p>
  If we want to lock the value in and never change it, we would use the <code>const</code> keyword.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const myNumber = 100
myNumber = 101
THIS WILL THROW AN ERROR IT WILL NOT WORK
</code></pre>

<h3>So which to use <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>?</h3>
<p>
  My personal recommendation is to take it easy on yourself and mostly stick to <code>let</code> when your starting out. <code>const</code> errors from reassigning aren't hard to spot, but when starting out "simple" problems can still get annoying. Once you're more comfortable with code, you can definitely start using <code>const</code> properly, but don't sweat it if you just want to use <code>let</code> exclusively for now.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless of <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, don't forget that you can't reference a variable <i>before</i> you've actually created it!
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">myNumber = 100
let myNumber = 101
NO GOOD, YOU USED myNumber BEFORE YOU DEFINED IT
</code></pre>

    <hr />
    <p>Here are some starter rules for naming your variables</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names can <em>only</em> include letters, numbers, and underscores</li>
      <li>You can't start names with numbers</li>
      <li>No spaces allowed</li>
      <li>If a name needs multiple words, use camelCase, which means each new word is capitalized (except the first)</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-js">let thisIsHowToCamelCase = ‚úÖ
let no spaces = ‚ùå
let 1badExample = ‚ùå

<h2>Data Types</h2>

<p>
  So, up until now we've exclusively used numbers or text for our variables, but that's not the only things we can store. In Programming, there are many different kinds of <em>data types</em> that we can store, but here are some of the simple ones to start us off.
</p>

<h3>Numbers</h3>

<p>
  In JavaScript one of the most common values you'll find are <em>Number</em> types. And unlike other programming languages, it doesn't care if a number is a whole number (also called an "Integer") or a decimal (sometimes referred to as a "Float").
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">12
14242.23
</code></pre>

<p>
  You can also do math with javascript, here are some of the basic operations
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">+ = addition
- = subraction
/ = division
* = multiplication
</code></pre>

<p>
  There's also a <i>real</i> handy trick when doing simple math operations. When making a variable bigger, a variable can reference itself to calculate a new value. Take this example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">let a = 5
a = a + 10
</code></pre>

<p>
  Our variable <code>a</code> is now 15. I know the "referencing itself" thing is weird, but you get used to it. Anyway, there's actually a shortcut to do that same exact thing.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">let a = 5
a += 10
</code></pre>

<p>
  Once again, <code>a</code> is now 15. And it's not just addition. The <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>/=</code>, and <code>*=</code> assignment operators are a great way to increment or decrement values.
</p>

<p>Obviously, you can do a <i>lot</i> with math and numbers in programming, but for our purposes this is good enough for now.</p>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>
  In JavaScript a piece of text is called a <code>String</code>. A string is a weird name for text, but thing about it like a piece of text is a bunch of individual characters "strung" along one after the other. Strings are created by putting anything between either double (") or single quotes('). Either one is fine, just make sure they match!
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">let string = "I am a string"
let otherString = 'So Am I'
</code></pre>

<p>
  The only tricky thing with strings at this stage is making sure if you use a single quote for a word like "don't", be sure to use double quotes for the whole string so javascript will know you don't want the string to end.
</p>


<pre><code class="language-js">let tricky = "Well, I'm going to use double quotes"</code></pre>

<div class="pattern aside-border">
  <aside>
    <h2 class="aside-header">There Is Another...</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Using quotes is great, but there's a problem. What if we wanted to put a piece of data into a string that <i>changes</i>? There's actually a <i>another</i> way to make strings with dynamic parts, but you'll learn about later, stay tuned!</p>
  </aside>
</div>

<h3>Booleans</h3>

<p>
  That is a wonky name, but this is just what we call <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> in programming. Also called a "bool" for short. In javascript, bools are lowercase. And don't put them in quotes, they aren't text, they're actual values.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myBoolean = true
myBoolean = false</code></pre>

<p>
  Booleans are primarily used for something called <em>Flow Control</em>, which is how a program decides whether or not something should be done. Just like humans do, we take in information before making a decision. Like, if it is raining, we bring an umbrella, otherwise we do not. But more on that later!
</p>

<h3>Undefined and Null</h3>

<p>
  Sometimes the value we want to save is ...no value. Just like with numbers, where it's useful to have a value for nothing 0, with variables you sometimes want to explicitly say a value is nothing. Not 0, but actually nothing. That's what <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> are. There is a difference between them, but don't worry about it for now.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">let nothing = undefined
let alsoNothing = null
</code></pre>
<p>
  At this stage in the game, we likely aren't going to intentionally use either of them, however it's good for you to know about <code>undefined</code> specifically becuase of errors. Sometimes when JavaScript expects something but gets nothing, the value will show up as <code>undefined</code>. This is your hint that something is going wrong in your pogram and you should investigate further.
</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>These aren't really a <i>data type</i> exactly, but they are useful to know. a <code>comment</code> is a chunk of text that is not seen by the program. It's useful for writing notes to yourself or your team members. Comments are an excellent way to keep relevant information about the program next to the source code, just be careful not to overdo it.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">// I am a single line comment

/*
  I am a multi line comment,
  anything inside me won't
  be seen by the program!
*/

// you can also stack
// single line comments
// together like this
// (This is more common)
</code></pre>

If you're wondering why the stacked single line comments are more common, it's a good question. The reason is becuase most code editing programs have a special command to comment out highlighted code, and going line by line allows for much more precision. Replit does this too, so you'll see why it's handy when working on the the challenge.

<div class="pattern aside-border">
  <aside>
    <h2 class="aside-header">A Quick Peek Ahead</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There are 2 slightly more complex data types called <code>Objects</code> and <code>Arrays</code>. An <code>Array</code> is simply a list of things.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">let people = ['Bob', 'Sara', 'Jake']</code></pre>
    <p>They're great, but we don't need them yet. The one we will <i>kind</i> of need is the <code>Object</code>. An <code>Object</code> is a bunch of key and value pairs. Where a <em>key</em> (usually called a <em>property</em>) points to a specific <em>value</em>.</p>
    <p>
      Or to put it another way, use <em>dot notation</em> with a <em>property name</em> to get a <em>value</em>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">let bob = {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 32,
  isCool: true,
}
bob.name
// This would be 'Bob'
bob.age
// this would be 32
bob.isCool
// and of course this would be true</code></pre>
    <p>
      We will not be writing any objects ourselves just yet, however, we will be using some properties of objects that JavaScript gives us. All you really need to know is: <em>to access a value on an object, put a "." and then the property name</em>. Don't worry, you'll understand better when we need to use them for real later on.
    </p>
  </aside>
</div>

<h3>Moving on: Functions!</h3>
<p>
  Now that know how to save values, but what about saving actions? Let's learn about <code>Functions</code> next! This lesson was boring, I know, but once we have functions at our fingertips, we can finally make programs that <i>do</i> something. Let's go!
