<h1>Lesson 6: Problem Solving</h1>
<h2 id='sub-title'>Code Challenge Tutorial</h2>
<p>
  This lesson is going to step through an example code challenge from start to finish. We'll go over how to break down questions so they can be solved, and learn about effective Googling. This lesson is by far the longest, but we really will solve everything exactly as if this were a real Marcy Challenge. If you're a beginner I really do recommend sticking through it.
</p>

<h2>What do you get?</h2>
<p>
  When it comes to code challenges, they can vary quite a bit. But <i>usually</i> you will get the following info:
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li><em>Description:</em> The problem explained in words.</li>
  <li><em>Argument info:</em> What data will you be supplied with.</li>
  <li><em>Return request:</em> What is your function returning?</li>
  <li><em>Examples:</em> A few sample inputs and outputs to see what's expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Every real world challenge is different, but each of those items will be given to you for this challenge. Let's take a look at our sample problem below.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<div id="question-1">

  <h3>Question 1: Ouija()</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Write a function <code class="snip">ouija</code> that takes a <code class="snip">String</code> argument, <code class="snip">word</code>.
  The function should <em>RETURN</em> a random letter character from the given word each time. The case from the word character should match the return value. If a string has no valid return characters, return an empty string.</blockquote>

  <table>
    <caption>Argument Info</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>word</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>A string consisting of <i>only</i> upper and lowercase letters</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <div class="pattern aside-border">
    <aside>
      <h2 class="aside-header">Example Code</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>When you enter this code:</p>

<p>
  This "mental framework" gives you just enough guidance without getting in the way. Let's break the problem down with those steps!
</p>

<h2>Step 1: The Question</h2>
<p>
  The key to solving a problem is to make sure you <i>understand</i> the problem. Whenever you are given a task, always read it at least twice. Don't start working until you understand <i>exactly</i> what is being asked of you. If you can restate the problem using your own words, you can move on. For this problem, I would say:
</p>

<blockquote>
  We're going to write a function called Ouija, and it only takes a single word as an argument. It will return a single random character directly from the word. If the string is all capitals, the return will always be capital, same with lowercase. If the word passed in is an empty string, then we just return it.
</blockquote>

<p>
  If you do not understand the question, you won't find the solution. This step sets us up for success.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Solve with words</h2>
<p>
  It's time to try and find <i>a</i> solution. Not <i>the</i> solution, <em>any</em> solution. When solving a question for the first time, it's much easier to improve a working answer than it is to wait for the <i>perfect</i> answer.
</p>
<p>
  We are just going to focus on coming up with any logically working strategy by using our words. <em>Do not code yet</em>. Think about how you would solve the problem as a human first. What I mean by that is, if I literally told you to do this without a computer what would you do?
</p>
<h3>The human solution</h3>
<p>
  If I was asked by someone to look at a word and say a random letter, how would I do it? If I was handed an empty word, I'd say nothing. But if I got a real word, I would look at each letter of the word, then to "randomize" it, I would sort of ping-pong between them for a bit, then I would just say one.
</p>
<p>
  Broken into a list:
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Read the word</li>
  <li>If it's empty, say nothing</li>
  <li>Otherwise, I'd look at the letters and randomly pick one</li>
  <li>I would then say that letter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Convert to pseudo-code</h2>
<p>
  OK! That human solve part of this step is <i>critical</i> because it means that if we could come up with an answer, so could a robot! Now all we have to do is think about the steps we took as a human and turn them into <em>pseudo code</em>. We still aren't coding yet, just using general jargon. No need for syntax; only rough ideas.
</p>

<h3>"Read the word"</h3>
<p>
  Computers don't read with their eyes, but they can take in arguments for their functions. So this is the part where we pass in the argument. Ok, so step one is "pass in the word as an argument."
</p>

<h3>"If it's empty..."</h3>
<p>
  Alright, so how does a computer know a word is empty? Well, all strings have length right? So, an empty string probably has a length of 0. Alright, so we check if the string has a length of 0 and if it does, then lets "say nothing" by returning an empty string. That's what the prompt asked for, and the return lets us avoid the rest of the function. Second step is "Check if there's a length, return the empty string if not."
</p>

<h3>"Read it an pick a random letter"</h3>
<p>
  Ok, here's our first real limitation. Computers can't just look at a word and "know" where all the letters are. They would have to iterate through it letter by letter. That seems like a waste of time. We only need to pick a single, random letter. What if we could pick a random index (ie a number) and then return whatever character is there?
</p>
<p>
  Ah, but we can't just pick <i>any</i> random number, if we overshoot the last index, I'll return <code>undefined</code>. So, it sounds like what I would need is the ability to pick a random number from 0 to the last index of the word.
</p>
<p>
  Hm. I didn't teach that you that did I? That's ok though, because the ability to "pick a random number between 0 and the last index" seems like something a computer could absolutely do. Let's assume it can for now, and move on.
</p>
<h3>"Say the letter"</h3>
<p>
  This is easy, whatever number we picked randomly, we'll just return the value at that index of the string. Done! Ok, so let's see our "code" answer below:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Human solution</th>
    <th>Robot solution</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Read the word</td>
      <td>Pass in the word as an argument</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>if it's empty, say nothing</td>
      <td>If the string has no length, return the string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Otherwise, look at the letters and randomly pick one</td>
      <td>Otherwise, find a random number from 0 to the last index of the string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Say the letter</td>
      <td>Return the value at the random index of the string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Move on to solving</h3>
<p>
  There you go! That's more than enough to get us going. It's ok that we don't even know how to actually solve that, because we can just Google things for this challenge.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Make Checkpoints</h2>
<p>
  Now that we have a plan, we need to set some markers so we know we're making progress. This is important because we want to show our interviewer that even if we didn't make it to the end, at least we were on some path.
</p>
<p>
  When determining a checkpoint, you want each one to build on the last. Each checkpoint should really return or log some concrete value so you can track progress.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Checkpoint</th>
    <th>Goal</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Call the function, and always return the word</td>
      <td>We see a return value of the word</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Return "" for empty words, <code>false</code> otherwise</td>
      <td>We know our conditional statement is correct</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>console.log a random, valid index if the word exists</td>
      <td>Figure out how random works with JavaScript</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Return random letter</td>
      <td>Last check point means we're done!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Step 4: Code!</h2>
<p>
  Pretty crazy that we don't touch the keyboard until step 4 right? Well that's because if you do it right, the coding isn't the hard part. If you come up with a logical solution, then the coding is only translating and debugging.
</p>

<h3>Checkpoint 1</h3>
<p>
  To prove it, let's knock out our first checkpoint. We'll call the function with some different inputs so we can make sure we spelled everything correctly and have some info for the later steps. Each test should tell us something about our function, I've noted the end goals next to the logs here.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const ouija = (word) => {
  return word
}

console.log(ouija("abc")) // a lowercase letter
console.log(ouija("ABC")) // an uppercase letter
console.log(ouija("")) // ""
console.log(ouija("A")) // A
</code></pre>

<p>
  Some of our examples may be outputting the wrong thing, but we've got good cases to text with. Also, I put the comments there since this is a tutorial, but don't feel like you have to literally write things down if you don't want. There's only 4 tests so it should be easy to track outputs.
</p>

<h3>checkpoint 2</h3>
<p>
  Now, let's add a conditional check to only return the word if there's no length and <code>false</code> otherwise. That's a wrong return value, but that's ok, it's not sticking around. We just need to see that we log "" (which looks like nothing) correctly, compared to false.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const ouija = (word) => {
  if (!word.length) {
    return word
  }
  return false
}

console.log(ouija("abc")) // a lowercase letter
console.log(ouija("ABC")) // an uppercase letter
console.log(ouija("")) // ""
console.log(ouija("A")) // A
</code></pre>

<p>
  Does that answer make sense to you? <code>word.length</code> will only be 0 if it's empty. That's also the only <code>falsy</code> number. Conditionals only fire for <code>true</code> though, so that's why we use the bang operator to flip it. If that's confusing to you, go check out lesson 3 again. Specifically: truthy and falsy numbers, inverting boolean values, and not needing else cases with return.
</p>

<h3>checkpoint 3</h3>
<p>
  We'll have to put a pin in this, because this is the checkpoint were we don't know what to do! So now it's time to Google! Obviously, if you were in an interview where Googling is not allowed, then you'd have to find another solution. But for Marcy, as stated, GOOGLING IS TOTALLY FINE. You may not need it for the application questions, but you it's still a crucial skill to have, so let's talk about it!
</p>

<h2>How to Google Questions</h2>
<p>
  When it comes to googling questions, the name of the game is specificity. You want to ask very focused questions, so that you don't get lost in the internet. So let's talk about formatting. If our question in normal-speak is:
</p>

<blockquote>How do I make a random number in javascript between 0 and one less than the final length of the sting?</blockquote>

<p>
  So let's edit that. Our final goal is this format:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">[Language] | how to | short question</code></pre>

<p>
  The trickiest part is "shortening" our question. So "how do I make a random number" becomes "get random number", ditch the "in javascript" because we put that at the start. And "between 0 and one less than the length of the string" needs some work. Let's think about it. Technically, "one less than the length of the string" just boils down to a number. so what we're really asking is "Between 0 and another number." And actually, we don't care about 0 either. Yes, we know that we'll need it for our problem, but if we can find a random number between 2 numbers, then we could just swap the first for 0 and the second for length - 1. So we <i>really</i> only need "between 2 numbers.""
</p>
<p>
  Whew! Ok let's see what we got:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">js how to get random number between 2 numbers</code></pre>

<p>
  Look how much shorter that is! And just a little tip from a pro: "between 2 numbers" has a fancy name in programming, it's called <em>a range</em>. So, if we really wanted we'd do:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">js how to get random number from range </code></pre>

<h3>Finding the answer</h3>
<p>
  Either way, we'd plug that into Google, and come up with a few search results. Don't always go for the first result, take a look at the first few titles, but basically keep going until you get your answer. I'm going with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">official MDN docs</a>, which gives me this snippet of code:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">Math.floor(Math.random() * num)</code></pre>

<p>
  Here's a fun challenge. Instead of me explaining that, why don't you try reading the docs figure it out? Here's a different <a href="https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-generate-a-random-number-between-a-range-in-javascript">blog explaining .random()</a> as well. Does the code make sense now?
</p>

<h3>Copying vs understanding</h3>
<p>
  When you first start out, it's ok for code you find to confuse you. The only really important thing is that you <i>mostly</i> understand every piece you put into your code base. Don't just mindlessly copy things, actually read the code and alter it as necessary. Case in point, I had to replace <code>num</code> with <code>word.length</code> in order to get it to work. You <i>will</i> be asked about your code, so be sure whatever you copy is something you could explain to an interviewer.
</p>
<p>
  For instance if you did use that line but didn't fully get it, an acceptable level of understanding would be, "I'm not exactly sure how floor() works, but combined with random(), it gives me a random number every time."
</p>


<h3>Back to check 3</h3>
<p>
  With my new code, my second to last checkpoint becomes
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const ouija = (word) => {
  if (!word.length) {
    return word
  }
  let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * word.length)
  return false
}

console.log(ouija("abc")) // a lowercase letter
console.log(ouija("ABC")) // an uppercase letter
console.log(ouija("")) // ""
console.log(ouija("A")) // A
</code></pre>

<h3>Checkpoint 4</h3>
<p>
  And finally, the last step is easy once we have our random number. Just return the value at the index!
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const ouija = (word) => {
  if (!word.length) {
    return word
  }
  let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * word.length)
  return word[index]
}

console.log(ouija("abc")) // a lowercase letter
console.log(ouija("ABC")) // an uppercase letter
console.log(ouija("")) // ""
console.log(ouija("A")) // A
</code></pre>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>
  WHEW, that was a doozy of a lesson, but it's important to go slow now, so we can go fast later. And I don't want you to get hung up on these exact steps. As you get more advanced, things will morph and join together. Like I move so quickly between the "human" and "robot" solution it's kind of just the same step.
</p>
<p>
  This is like training wheels. Once you understand the patterns, feel free to move and change them to what works for you.
</p>

<h3>A final note on debugging</h3>
<p>
  Obviously, things are going to break while you're working. People tend to think of problems like a house fire: everything is chaos, and it only gets solved all at once with a specific solution (a firehose). But real debugging is like a broken chain. There can be one or many broken links, some total some partial, all are a problem.
</p>
<p>
  But the way to fix a broken chain is to start at a link you know is correct, and then inspect each one until you find the problem links. When you have a problem with your code, take a step back, find the parts that you <i>know</i> work, and then move forward each step. That's why coding with checkpoints is so critical. it keeps problems from getting too big, because each piece only adds a little logic at a time.
</p>

<h3>Good Luck!</h3>
<p>
  And that's all we have for now! Feel free to check out the resources section for a list on good sites and videos, but you're ready for the challenges now! If you still want some more practice, give the problems below a try, and then check the answer Replit.

      Write a function <code class="snip">triangleSlices</code> that takes a <code class="snip">String</code> argument, <code class="snip">word</code>. This function should iterate through the word, and print a "triangle" of text. The way it will do this is starting with only the first character, each line will have one more character of the <code>word</code> printed. The last line will have the entire word.
