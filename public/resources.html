<h1>Resources</h1>
<h2 id='sub-title'>Useful sites and videos</h2>
<p>
  There are a truly ludicrous number of sites out there to get you going. This is just a place to get you started if this world is new to you. First let's talk about what the various <i>types</i> of resources are good for.
</p>

<h2>Focused Questions</h2>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JS MDN Documentation</a>
<p>
  When it comes to specific answers like "how do I get a random number in js between 2 numbers," one of your best bets is <em>Stack Overflow</em>. This website is literally just millions of questions and answers, and 8/10 times will be the first or second result in Google. When searching, be sure to read the question to make sure it really <i>is</i> what you're trying to do. Then, there is an <em>accepted answer,</em> but always take a look at all the answers, since sometimes there may be a better one below.
</p>
<p>
  You also might wind up on the <em>Official Docs</em> for JavaScript. The "docs" for any language sound scary, but honestly nowadays they're usually pretty user friendly. They are very long, so you may have to just skip to the code example bit to see what they're talking about. But they can be helpful.
</p>

<h2>A Small Topic</h2>
<p>Blogs, Short Videos</p>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3 Schools</a>

<p>
  Sometimes, you have a more nebulous idea in mind. Like "What are some common string methods for JS?" In that case, you're better off trying to look for focused mini lessons. W3 Schools is a truly phenomenal resource for this, as you can pretty much search it like a catalog and see whatever interests you. It cover JS, but also HTML and CSS. Also don't sleep on its interactive code windows, I use those all the time to just quickly try out new concepts. As for good blogs, I'll link to some below.
</p>

<h2>Full Languages</h2>
<p>Video Tutorials, Online Courses</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M">Free Code Camp</a>
<a href="https://nostarch.com/">Programming Books</a>

<p>
  There's a saying "You don't know what you don't know." That is to say, when you're <i>totally</i> new to something you won't know what you should be looking up. In those cases, I highly recommend a self-driven online course, book, or video. These are made by people who have carefully selected the things that you won't know to Google, and laid them out in a coherent path. There are some really phenomenal videos from Free Code Camp (more on them below), and I've used them a lot in the past. No Starch is not the only publisher, but a lot of their stuff can be Googled as PDFs online for free.
</p>

<h2>The Best Resources</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV</a>
    <p>Type: Blogs</p>
    <p>
      This site hosts 100% free articles, with a vibrant community and excellent syntax highlighting functions. It's articles overwhelmingly favor "beginner" articles, but hey, that's you!

    <a href="https://dev.to/">Medium</a>
    <p>Type: Blogs</p>
    <p>
      They recently put up a paywall system which blows, but the fact is they do have a lot of good content. Both beginner friendly, but also covers a lot of advanced topics as well. It's a clean interface, unfortunately the native code highlighting system is absolute trash.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M">Free Code Camp</a>
    <p>Type: Videos, Blogs</p>
    <p>
      I love both this youtube site AND the blogs they put out as well. My go to site for big ideas, and their dedication to free content is admirable. The 5+ hours look daunting, but they're always worth it!

    <br>
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
    <p>Type: Blogs, Hot Gossip</p>
    <p>
      An interface from 2001 might look scary, but there are some really interesting articles on here. Also the latest tech news breaks on here, so it's a good place to sometimes stay ahead of the curve.
    </p>

    <br>

    <br>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/">Reddit</a>
    <p>Type: Everything under the sun</p>
    <p>
      Obviously Reddit is huge, but some of the "subreddits" (think of these like mini-communities) are super helpful for beginners. I recommend the JS community, but there are so many different topics to choose from.
    </p>

    <br>
    <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/">Flavio Copes</a>
    <p>Type: Blogs, Books</p>
    <p>
      Flavio is an absolute machine. He has put out so many individual tutorials, you'll almost certainly hit him in Google if you search long enough. But in addition to all his articles, he also writes totally free eBooks that you can download or read in browser.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo">Crash Course: Computer Science</a>
    <p>Type: Videos, Edutainment</p>
    <p>
      If you're <i>totally</i> new to the world of computing, this is actually an amazing speed run of the vital bits of comp science. It's about 40, ten minute videos and they really take you on a tour through the history of computing. It won't teach you programming, if you want that then try...

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T383f9scHRNYJkior2VvYjpSL">Harvard CS50 Course</a>
    <p>Type: Videos, Online Course</p>
    <p>
      This is literally Harvard's intro to computer science course. Like, the whole thing. I've linked to the video, but you can also literally take the course on EdX if you want. I've taken it, it's great.

    <br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M">WebDev Simplified</a>
    <p>Type: Videos, Blogs</p>
    <p>
      This man makes his videos like he does his hair: Perfectly. His videos cover JS, CSS, React, and more, but they are so tightly edited and helpful that you can't go wrong clicking a few.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/fireship">Fireship</a>
    <p>Type: Videos</p>
    <p>
      This channel is absolutely a little heavy into the memes, but it really does a great job at boiling things down into 100 second chunks. I highly recommend his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFc-RPbq8kg&list=LL&index=3&t=331s">Problem Solving</a> video.
