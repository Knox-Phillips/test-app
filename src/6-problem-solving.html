<h1>Lesson 6: Problem Solving</h1>
<h2 id='sub-title'>Code Challenge Tutorial</h2>
<p>
  This lesson is going to step through an example code challenge from start to finish. We'll go over how to break down questions so they can be solved, and learn about effective googling. If you're a beginner I really do recommend sticking through it.
</p>

<h2>What do you get?</h2>
<p>
  When it comes to code challenges, they can vary quite a bit. But <i>usually</i> you get the following info:
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li><em>Description:</em> The problem explained in words.</li>
  <li><em>Argument info:</em> What data will you be supplied with.</li>
  <li><em>Return request:</em> What is your function returning?</li>
  <li><em>Examples:</em> A few sample inputs and outputs to see what's expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each of those items will be given to you for Marcy's challenges. Let's take a look at our sample problem below.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<div id="question-1">

  <h3>Question 1: Ouija()</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Write a function <code class="snip">ouija</code> that takes a <code class="snip">String</code> argument, <code class="snip">word</code>.
  The function should <em>RETURN</em> a random character from the given word each time. The case from the word character should match the return value. If a string has no valid return characters, return an empty string.</blockquote>

  <table>
    <caption>Argument Info</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>word</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>A string consisting of <i>only</i> upper and lowercase letters</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h2>Step 1: Understanding</h2>
<p>
  The key to solving a problem is to make sure you <i>understand</i> the problem. Whenever you are given a task, always read it at least twice. Don't move on until you understand <i>exactly</i> what is being asked of you. Your goal here is to restate the problem in your own words. For this problem, I would say:
</p>

<blockquote>
  We're going to write a function called Ouija, and it only takes a single word as an argument. It will return a single random character directly from the word. If the string is all capitals, the return will be a capital, same with lowercase. If the word passed in is an empty string, then we just return it.
</blockquote>

<h2>Step 2: Solve with words</h2>
<p>
  It's time to try and find <i>a</i> solution. Not <i>the</i> solution, <em>any</em> solution. When solving a question for the first time, it's much easier to improve a working answer than it is to wait for the <i>perfect</i> answer.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Do not code yet</em>. Think about how you would solve the problem as a human first. What I mean by that is, if I literally told you to do this without a computer, what would you do?
</p>
<h3>The human solution</h3>
<p>
  If I was asked by someone to look at a word and say a random letter, what would I do? If I was handed an empty word, I'd say nothing. But if I got a real word, I would look at each letter of the word, then to "randomize" it, I would sort of ping-pong between them for a bit, then I would just say one.
</p>
<p>
  In other words:
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Read the word</li>
  <li>If it's empty, say nothing</li>
  <li>Otherwise, I'd look at the letters and randomly pick one</li>
  <li>I would then say that letter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Convert to pseudo-code</h2>
<p>
  OK! Since we found the answer as a human, that means there <i>is</i> a solution, and we just need to translate it to <em>pseudo code</em>! We still aren't coding yet, we're sticking with general jargon. No need for syntax; only rough ideas.
</p>

<h3>"Read the word"</h3>
<p>
  Computers don't read with their eyes, but they can take in arguments for their functions. So this is the part where we pass in the argument. Ok, so step one is "pass in the word as an argument."
</p>

<h3>"If it's empty..."</h3>
<p>
  How does a computer know a word is empty? Well, all strings have length right? Let's check if the string has a length of 0 and if it does, then let's "say nothing" by returning an empty string. That's what the prompt asked for, and the return lets us avoid the rest of the function. Second step is "Check if there's a length, return the empty string if not."
</p>

<h3>"Read it an pick a random letter"</h3>
<p>
  Ok, here's our first real limitation. Computers can't just look at a word and "know" where all the letters are. They would have to iterate through it letter by letter. But, we only need to pick a <i>single</i>, random letter. What if we could pick a random index (ie a number) and then return whatever character is there?
</p>
<p>
  Ah, but we can't just pick <i>any</i> random number, if we overshoot the last index, we'll return <code>undefined</code>. So, it sounds like what we need is the ability to pick a random number from 0 to the last index of the word.
</p>
<p>
  Hm. I didn't teach that you that did I? That's ok, because the ability to "pick a random number between 0 and the last index" seems like something a computer could absolutely do. Let's assume it can for now, and move on.
</p>
<h3>"Say the letter"</h3>
<p>
  This is easy, whatever number we picked randomly, we'll just return the value at that index of the string. Done! Ok, so let's see our "code" answer below compared to our "human" solution:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Human solution</th>
    <th>Pseudo Code</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Read the word</td>
      <td>Pass in the word as an argument</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>if it's empty, say nothing</td>
      <td>If the string has no length, return the string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Otherwise, look at the letters and randomly pick one</td>
      <td>Otherwise, find a random number from 0 to the last index of the string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Say the letter</td>
      <td>Return the value at the random index of the string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Move on to solving</h3>
<p>
  There you go! That's more than enough to get us going. Time can be a factor with code challenges, so all you're looking for is a <i>rough</i> plan.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Make Checkpoints</h2>
<p>
  Now that we have that plan, we need to set some markers so track our progress. When deciding on checkpoints, focus on coming up with little goals that will give you mental momentum. Small, but achievable. Each checkpoint should return or log some concrete value, even if it's not the final answer. Here are the ones I came up with.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Checkpoint</th>
    <th>Goal</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Call the function, and always return the word</td>
      <td>We see a return value and spelled everything right</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Return "" for empty words, <code>false</code> otherwise</td>
      <td>We know our conditional statement is correct</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>console.log a random, valid index if the word exists</td>
      <td>Figure out how random works with JavaScript</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Return random letter</td>
      <td>Last check point means we're done!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Step 4: Code!</h2>
<p>
  Pretty crazy that we don't touch the keyboard until step 4 right? Well that's because if you do it correctly, the coding isn't the hard part. If you come up with a logical solution, then the coding is only translating and debugging.
</p>

<h3>Checkpoint 1</h3>
<p>
  To prove coding isn't the hard part, let's knock out our first checkpoint. We'll call the function with some different inputs so we can make sure we spelled everything correctly and have some info for the later steps. Each log is like a test, and it should tell us something about our function, I've noted the <i>end</i> goals next to the logs here.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const ouija = (word) => {
  return word
}

console.log(ouija("abc")) // lowercase letter
console.log(ouija("ABC")) // uppercase letter
console.log(ouija("")) // ""
console.log(ouija("A")) // A
</code></pre>

<p>
  Some of our examples will be outputting the wrong thing for now, but that's ok.
</p>

<h3>checkpoint 2</h3>
<p>
  Now, let's add a conditional check to only return the word if there's no length and <code>false</code> otherwise. The <code>false</code> won't stick around, we just need to see that we log "" OR <code>false</code>, you could use any other value.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const ouija = (word) => {
  if (!word.length) {
    return word
  }
  return false
}

console.log(ouija("abc")) // lowercase letter
console.log(ouija("ABC")) // uppercase letter
console.log(ouija("")) // ""
console.log(ouija("A")) // A
</code></pre>

<p>
  Does that answer make sense to you? <code>word.length</code> will only be 0 if it's empty. That's also the only <code>falsy</code> number. Conditionals only fire for <code>true</code>, so that's why we use the bang operator to flip it. If that's confusing, go check out lesson 3 again. Specifically: truthy and falsy, inverting booleans, and not needing else cases with return.
</p>

<h3>checkpoint 3</h3>
<p>
  We'll have to put a pin in this, because this is the checkpoint were we don't know what to do. That means it's time to Google. You may not need it for the application questions, but you it's still a crucial skill!
</p>

<h2>How to Google Questions</h2>
<p>
  When it comes to googling questions, the name of the game is specificity. You want to ask very focused questions, so that you don't get lost in the internet. If our question in normal-speak is:
</p>

<blockquote>How do I make a random number in javascript between 0 and one less than the final length of the sting?</blockquote>

<p>
  Our final goal is this format:
</p>

<blockquote>[Language] | how to | short question</blockquote>

<p>
  The trickiest part is "shortening" our question. So "how do I make a random number" becomes "get random number", ditch the "in javascript" because we put that at the start. But "between 0 and one less than the length of the string" needs some work. Let's think about it.
</p>
<p>
  "one less than the length of the string" is really just a number. So, what we're asking is "Between 0 and another number." Actually, we don't care about 0 either. We'll need it for our problem, but if we can find a random number between 2 numbers, then we could just swap the first for 0. We <i>really</i> only need "between 2 numbers."
</p>
<p>
  Whew! Ok let's see what we got:
</p>
<blockquote>js how to get random number between 2 numbers</blockquote>

<p>
  Look how much shorter that is! And just a little tip from a pro: "between 2 numbers" has a fancy name in programming, it's called <em>a range</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>js how to get random number from range </blockquote>

<h3>Finding the answer</h3>
<p>
  Either way, we'd plug that into Google, and come up with a few search results. Don't always go for the first result, take a look at the first few titles. I'm going with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">official MDN docs</a>, which gives me this snippet of code:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">Math.floor(Math.random() * num)</code></pre>

<p>
  Here's a fun challenge. Instead of me explaining, why don't you try reading the docs figure it out? Here's a different <a href="https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-generate-a-random-number-between-a-range-in-javascript">blog explaining .random()</a> as well. Does the code make sense now?
</p>

<h3>Back to checkpoint 3</h3>
<p>
  Our second to last checkpoint is to put that code in (broken into 2 lines for mobile readers), and then log the index temporarily to check our work.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const ouija = (word) => {
  if (!word.length) {
    return word
  }
  let randomNum = Math.random() * word.length
  let index = Math.floor(randomNum)
  console.log('index:', index)
  return false
}

console.log(ouija("abc")) // lowercase letter
console.log(ouija("ABC")) // uppercase letter
console.log(ouija("")) // ""
console.log(ouija("A")) // A
</code></pre>

<h3>Copying vs understanding</h3>
<p>
  It's ok for copied code to confuse you for now. The only important thing is that you <i>mostly</i> understand it. Don't mindlessly copy things, read the code and alter it as necessary. Case in point, I had to replace <code>num</code> with <code>word.length</code> in order to get it to work.
</p>
<p>
  You <i>will</i> be asked about your code, so be sure you can talk about any aspect of it. For instance, an acceptable level of understanding would be, "I'm not exactly sure how floor() works, but combined with random(), it gives me a random number every time."
</p>

<h3>Checkpoint 4</h3>
<p>
  The last step is easy now, just return the value at the index!
</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const ouija = (word) => {
  if (!word.length) {
    return word
  }
  let randomNum = Math.random() * word.length
  let index = Math.floor(randomNum)
  return word[index]
}

console.log(ouija("abc")) // lowercase letter
console.log(ouija("ABC")) // uppercase letter
console.log(ouija("")) // ""
console.log(ouija("A")) // A
</code></pre>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>
  There's a quote I really like, "Slow is smooth and smooth is fast." I know it can be a pain to take all this time to plan when you just want to <i>code</i>, but that's a trap. By slowing down to take time to understand the problem and come up with a plan, you'll save time in the long run.
</p>

<h3>A note on debugging</h3>
<p>
  People think of errors like a house fire: everything is chaos, and it gets solved all at once with an obvious fix. But real debugging is like a broken chain. The way to fix a chain is to start at a link you know is correct, and then inspect each one until you find the problems.
</p>
<p>
  When you have a problem with your code, take a step back, find the parts that you <i>know</i> work, and then move on from there. That's why coding with checkpoints is so critical. It keeps problems from getting too big, because each piece only adds a little logic at a time.
</p>

<h3>Good Luck!</h3>
<p>
  You're ready for the challenges! If you still want some more practice, give the problems below a try, but some of the <i>real</i> challenges are technically easier.
</p>
